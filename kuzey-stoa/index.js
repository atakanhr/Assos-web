            paragraph1: 'Stoas were highly functional, multi-storied buildings where meetings and commercial activities took place. In the Hellenistic period, the two-storey stoas were enclosed with a row of columns. Daylight, for lighting and heating purposes, and landscape were each taken into consideration in determining the location of the stoa building.  Below todays visible North Stoa lies the first stoa building from the 4th century B.C.. Its remains were found during the excavation. In the 2nd century B.C. a new stoa was built, which was larger than the older and has a different orientation. The first floor of the northern stoa, which is the largest building in the agora, leans against rocky conglomerate. A gap was left between the bedrock and the northern wall to prevent the building from suffering over time from the moisture caused by rainwater. The stoa (12.5 x 111.5 m) had a height of approximately 12.60 meters. The second floor was 5.70 meters; the third floor was 3.19 meters high. There were a total of 37 columns at 2.63 meter intervals on the fa\u00E7ades of both floors. The columns on the second floor consisted of small, double columns. The interior had 20 columns each with thinner grooves, which became progressively thinner on each floor. Only the shield reliefs on the pediments of the stoa, and the capitals of the second floor were made of marble. The leaf-decorated marble capitals were produced in Pergamon (Bergama). A four-step ladder extended along the southern fa\u00E7ade of the stoa, and the front columns of the first floor were enclosed with guardrail plates. It is estimated that these balustrades were implemented to direct the flow of foot-traffic. The upper sections of the northern walls were built with large planks to help bear the weight of the highers floors. In the 4th century A.D., the western part of the stoa was used as a shop for bone tools. In the 5th century A.D., the building was deliberately abandoned. During that time the stoa was filled with building rubble, creating a larger space for the residential area above the stoa. \r\n',
